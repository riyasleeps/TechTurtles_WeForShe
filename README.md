Vintage Classification Project
Overview
This project includes a web application for showcasing vintage-inspired fashion items and an AI model that classifies clothing as vintage or not using a Random Forest algorithm. The web app is built with HTML and CSS, and the AI model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file for the web application. It contains the structure and content of the website.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the web application. It defines the visual presentation of the HTML elements.
Women_Fashion_Trend_Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the AI model for vintage classification. This notebook uses a Random Forest algorithm to predict whether clothing items are vintage-inspired.

Usage
Web Application:
Open index.html in a web browser to view the website.
AI Model:
The model can be used to classify clothing items as vintage or not by executing the cells in Women_Fashion_Trend_Model.ipynb. Update the dataset and paths in the notebook as needed.

Notes
Ensure the AI model is trained with a dataset relevant to vintage fashion for accurate predictions.
Customize the index.html and styles.css files as needed to fit the design and functionality requirements of your project.
